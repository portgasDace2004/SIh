Welcome to the Smart Parking App project on GitHub! This project aims to revolutionize the way we experience urban parking by providing a user-friendly mobile app and a powerful web portal for efficient parking management. Below, you'll find a detailed README to help you understand the project's goals, features, and how to get started.

Project Overview

Problem Statement

Parking in urban areas can be a time-consuming and frustrating experience, often leading to wasted time and fuel. This project addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive solution for both users and parking authorities.

Solution

Our solution consists of a user-friendly mobile app and a web portal that offers the following key features:

	1	**User-Friendly Mobile App:**
   - An intuitive interface for a seamless user experience.
   - Real-time parking space occupancy detection using ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) cameras.
   - Integration with the Google Maps API for finding parking spaces near the user's current location or a specific destination.
   - Reservation of parking spots with dynamic pricing considerations.
   - Interactive map with available spots in green and full spots in red.
   - Turn-by-turn navigation to guide users to their chosen parking space.
   - Algorithm-driven parking pricing adjustments based on demand, time of day, and location.
   - Transparent display of current parking fares for each spot.
   - Integration with a secure payment gateway for reservations and payments through UPI.
   - Automatic fare deduction from Fasttag accounts using ALPR technology if a slot is not booked.

2. **Web Portal for Parking Authorities:**
   - Real-time monitoring of parking space occupancy.
   - Tracking of parking violations.
   - Generation of comprehensive reports for data-driven decisions.
   - Tools for adjusting parking pricing and policies as needed.

3. **Scalability and Expansion:**
   - The project is designed with scalability in mind to accommodate more parking spaces and users over time.
   - There's potential for expansion to other cities or regions as the app proves successful.

4. **Feedback and Issues:**
   - We welcome feedback and bug reports. Please use the Issues tab on GitHub to report any problems or suggest enhancements.

5. **License:**
   - This project is licensed under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for details.

Future Development

We are continually working to enhance this project. Some potential future developments include:

	●	Enhancing the algorithm for parking pricing optimization.
	●	Implementing additional payment methods.
	●	Improving user behaviour analysis to further enhance the app's features.
